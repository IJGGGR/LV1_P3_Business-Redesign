Peer Review: (Daniel Herrera)

Website looks great! I recommend adjusting the padding on the text background color on top of the hero images. (Increase the top padding or have the text in the very center of the background color.)

In the location page(Mobile), adjust the overall size of the map to make it wider.

In the menu page: The store phone number is inside of an a tag while the other pages have the phone number in a p tag. Please keep the footer consistent with all pages.
